<a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open source framework mainly used for web application that is maintained by Google and the open source community. The goal of Angular is to simplify both development and testing of single page applications <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank">(SPA)</a> by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">(MVC)</a> architecture, along with components commonly used in rich web applications.

Angular works by first reading the HTML page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. <strong>Attributes</strong> are interpreted as directives telling Angular to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.

<h4>Data-binding</h4>

Data-binding in Angular is the simultaneous occurrence of data between the model and view components. The way that Angular implements data-binding lets you utilize the model as the single source of truth in your application. The view is a projection of the model at all times. When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.

<h4>Expressions</h4>

In order to create the views of your application, AngularJS let you execute expressions directly within your pages. In those expressions, you have access Javascript.

<h4>Directives</h4>

Directives are an extremely powerful feature of the AngularJS framework. They allow you to extend HTML to create a rich web application. Directives let you specify how your page should be structured for the data available in a given scope.

AngularJS comes shipped with numerous directives which let you build your basic web application. <code>ngRepeat</code> is a directive which is commonly used in Angular. This directive lets AngularJS create a new set of elements in the dom for each element in a collection. Additionally, Angular comes with a set other built-in directives, like ngBind, ngModel, and ngClass. Much like you create controllers and services, you can create your own directives for Angular to use. When Angular bootstraps your application, the HTML compiler traverses the DOM matching directives against the DOM elements.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

Even though AngularJS is very simple to start with, it's a very complicated framework to get. Many relate the learning curve of Angular to be that of a hockey stick. There are literally hundereds of tutorals and resources available, along with a great community. See below for a list of AngularJS resources to get you started on the path to developing with Angular!
