    	<p><strong>Flat User Interface Design</strong> is a new form of creating a website which involves simplification and digital aesthetics to give a website a fresh and unique look. This design technique concentrates on making a website as easy to use as possible, which is an important trend in current web design. This type of design attracts the attention of Internet users and provides icons that make it easy to tell what the icon represents.</p>
<p>The main principles of a Flat User Interface design include a flat hierarchy and simple icons. Flat hierarchy makes a website much easier to navigate, which is crucial to the success of any website today. The layout is always clear and leaves no confusion about where on a website a particular piece of information is located. </p>
<p>Using nothing but basic content is another principle of this type of website design. Website content needs to be crisp and clean to attract people to the site and give them a reason to return to it. </p>
<p>Flat User Interface design involves using typography that will stand out on a web page and provide a visually appealing experience. The more simple a website is the more creative the typography should be. Even so, the text needs to fit the look of the rest of the website as well. Another important aspect of this type of website design is the colors used. The best technique is to use the same colors that are in the website’s logo for the background of the site. Flat User Interface generally does not employ the black/white color scheme. </p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2013, Flat UI design has become very popular due to the fact that it incorporates existing trends in website design. Mobile websites often use this design type. </p>

<p><a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, commonly referred to as Angular, is an open source framework mainly used for web application that is maintained by Google and the open source community. The goal of Angular is to simplify both development and testing of single page applications <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank">(SPA)</a> by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">(MVC)</a> architecture, along with components commonly used in rich web applications.</p>
<p>Angular works by first reading the HTML page, which has embedded into it additional custom tag attributes. <strong>Attributes</strong> are interpreted as directives telling Angular to bind input or output parts of the page to a model that is represented by standard JavaScript variables. The values of those JavaScript variables can be manually set within the code, or retrieved from static or dynamic JSON resources.</p>
<h4>Data-binding</h4>

<p>Data-binding in Angular is the simultaneous occurrence of data between the model and view components. The way that Angular implements data-binding lets you utilize the model as the single source of truth in your application. The view is a projection of the model at all times. When the model changes, the view reflects the change, and vice versa.</p>
<h4>Expressions</h4>

<p>In order to create the views of your application, AngularJS let you execute expressions directly within your pages. In those expressions, you have access Javascript.</p>
<h4>Directives</h4>

<p>Directives are an extremely powerful feature of the AngularJS framework. They allow you to extend HTML to create a rich web application. Directives let you specify how your page should be structured for the data available in a given scope.</p>
<p>AngularJS comes shipped with numerous directives which let you build your basic web application. <code>ngRepeat</code> is a directive which is commonly used in Angular. This directive lets AngularJS create a new set of elements in the dom for each element in a collection. Additionally, Angular comes with a set other built-in directives, like ngBind, ngModel, and ngClass. Much like you create controllers and services, you can create your own directives for Angular to use. When Angular bootstraps your application, the HTML compiler traverses the DOM matching directives against the DOM elements.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>Even though AngularJS is very simple to start with, it’s a very complicated framework to get. Many relate the learning curve of Angular to be that of a hockey stick. There are literally hundereds of tutorals and resources available, along with a great community. See below for a list of AngularJS resources to get you started on the path to developing with Angular!</p>

    	<p>Hexo is a powerful, yet simple static blog framework created with nodejs.</p>
<p>Using Hexo you can create your blog rapidly by writing your content in markdown, a simple text format with no over the top formatting.</p>
<p>Content is presented in a elegantly crafted theme which is responsive and looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. Installing a theme is a simple process, and community contributed themes are readily available from github, and can be installed from the command line with little effort.</p>
<p>Hexo is a great alternative to users who are looking for an alternative to Wordpress, and a great starting point for beginners who are beginning their journey with javascript, and javascript frameworks.</p>
<h3>Why I like Hexo</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Node.js</strong>. I have recently dedicated as much time as I could getting my hands dirty and immersing myself in the world of dynamic computer languages. Node.js is a framework I am highly interested in and am jumping at any opportunity to hone my skills and increase my knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Built in server</strong>. Running <code>hexo server</code> will start a local web server allowing you to preview your post.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Markdown</strong> is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it optionally can be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name. Markdown is popularly used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums or in text editors for the quick creation of rich text documents. Also, did I mention autosave?</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Wordpress Migration</strong>. Hexo provides a plugin to quickly migrate your Wordpress posts into Hexo.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Plugins</strong>. Though Hexo only has a fraction of the plugins that are available for Wordpress users, the community has provided very useful plugins that you will actually probably use.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>How to install Hexo</h3>

<p><code>$ npm install hexo -g<br>$ hexo init blog<br>$ cd blog<br>$ npm install<br>$ hexo server</code></p>
<p>Detailed instructions can be found <a href="http://hexo.io/docs/" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p><strong>Hexo</strong> is a great, no nonsense blogging platform for developers who want to save time and provide compelling content in the quickest most efficient way. </p>
